"""Simulated network: a stand-in for the digital twin, used to drive the agent without Mininet / VIT / SENSE.

It holds the "ground truth": the topology, capacity used by others (per time range), link outages
(per time range), and the capacity we have reserved through SENSE. The mock telemetry (step 3a)
reads from it and the mock SENSE (step 3b) reads and writes it, so both see the same network.
This is the layer that gets replaced when we move to Mininet.

"Foreign traffic" and "our reservations" are stored separately: SENSE admission control has to count
both, while telemetry reports only foreign traffic (see schemas.LinkSample for the semantics); our
own reservations are accounted for by the ledger's ``own``.
