"""Placement search for quotes: on the ledger, find (start time, constant rate) placements for one
transfer along one path (slide 7, slide 19 P1).

Reads the ledger, never writes it; never calls SENSE. The first version uses three rules, each
producing one placement (later replaceable by a pluggable policy):

    earliest_start  the earliest possible start, at the highest rate sustainable from then on  → a1 in slide 7
    max_rate        the highest rate reachable in the window, at the earliest time it is reached  → a2
    min_rate        from the earliest start, the lowest rate that still meets latest_finish     → a3

The three rules are the trade-offs slide 7 describes: start early, occupy briefly, use little
capacity. The network agent only lists them and does not choose for the scheduling agent. Rates are
rounded to rate_step_gbps. Capacity checks use the same slot arithmetic as ledger.pending, so any
placement we quote can definitely be booked at reserve time (provided the ledger has not changed).
